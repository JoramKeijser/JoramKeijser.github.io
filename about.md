# Joram Keijser

I'm a PhD student in computational neuroscience in [the lab of Henning Sprekeler](https://www.sprekelerlab.org/). My PhD is funded by the [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) and [ECN Berlin](https://www.ecn-berlin.de/). Previously, I obtained a MSc in mathematics from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/). I'm interested in the inhibitory cell types, cortical population dynamics, and motor control. Most recently, my research on cell types has led me to the field of evolutionary developmental biology.

I've created this website because I wanted to start blogging, but might add more self branding later.
