# Joram Keijser

I'm a PhD student in computational at the TU Berlin, in the lab of [Henning Sprekeler](https://www.sprekelerlab.org/). I'm interested in the inhibitory cell types,  cortical population dynamics, and motor control. Most recently, my research on cell types has led me to the field of evolutionary developmental biology.
