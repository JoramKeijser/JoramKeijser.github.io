# Joram Keijser

I'm a PhD student in computational neuroscience in [the lab of Henning Sprekeler](https://www.sprekelerlab.org/). My PhD is funded by the [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) and [ECN Berlin](https://www.ecn-berlin.de/).  I'm interested in the inhibitory cell types, cortical population dynamics, and motor control. Most recently, my research on cell types has led me to the field of evolutionary developmental biology. Previously, I obtained a MSc in mathematics from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/)
