<span class="caption" STYLE="font-size:85%"> The pendulum loses energy until it stops in an equilbrium state (hanging down) with energy 0. 
 Since energy doesn't increase, the equilibrium position must be stable. Similar arguments can prove the stability of more complicated systems like neural network controllers if we use a generalized notion of energy called Lyapunov function. </span>

Coming soon.
