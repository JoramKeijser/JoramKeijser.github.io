# Low-dimensional manifolds in neuroscience and evolution

The brain contains billions of neurons, so you might think we need a billion numbers to describe what the brain is doing. But in practice, we donâ€™t need a billion numbers -- just a handful often goes a long way. The brain therefore typically visits only a small fraction of all its potential states. There is an analogous observation in evolutionary biology: The number of existing organisms is only a tiny fraction of all potential organisms. For example, there are no (and have never been) unicorns or centaurs, even though they are obviously conceivable to the human mind. In this blog pots, we will examine these analogous neural and evolutionary/developmental phenomena, and see what lessons can be draw from their
similarity. 

> **tl;dr** Low-dimensional patterns in neural space and organismal space are both caused by functional reasons, but also by constraints. This analogy suggests several insights for neuroscience, for example that disambiguating function and constraint requires a causal test. Causal tests have actually been done in several clever experiments that used brain computer interfaces and artificial selection.
