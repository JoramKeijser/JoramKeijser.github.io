# Low-dimensional manifolds in neuroscience and evolution

The brain contains billions of neurons, so you might think we need a billion numbers to describe what the brain's activity. But in practice, we don’t need a billion numbers -- just a handful often goes a long way. The brain therefore typically visits only a small fraction of all its potential states. There is an analogous observation in evolutionary biology: The number of existing organisms is only a tiny fraction of all potential organisms. For example, there are no (and have never been) unicorns or centaurs, even though they are obviously conceivable to the human mind. In this blog pots, we will examine these analogous neural and evolutionary/developmental phenomena, and see what lessons can be draw from their
similarity. 

> **tl;dr** Low-dimensional patterns in neural space and organismal space are both caused by functional reasons, but also by constraints. This analogy suggests several insights for neuroscience, for example that disambiguating function and constraint requires a causal test. Causal tests have actually been done in several clever experiments that used brain computer interfaces and artificial selection.

### Low-dimensional neural activity
Over a decade of large-scale neural recordings has revealed that the activity of a large number of neurons can often be captured by a much smaller number of key dimensions. In auditory cortex, for example, neural population activity rotates in a low-dimensional space that depends on the sound stimulus, which sets the population's initial state ([Bondanelli et al.](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.53151)). The initial state can also be used to incorporate prior expectations into the dynamics, integrating them with sensory evidence in Bayes-optimal way ([Sohn et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.06.012)). Although in both of these cases, neural activity is not fully explained by two or three dimensions, these dimensions do relate to behavior in an interpretable way. But human interpretability is not one of the brain’s design principles, raising the question why neural activity should be low-dimensional.

The two colours correspond to different sounds, that elicited activity in orthogonal planes. (b) Activity in frontal cortex during time estimation. The activity is warped depending on subjects' prior expectation of the time interval (shown in blue and red), and the actual duration of the time interval (shown in dark vs. light).

It's much easier to observe and compare a lot of animals than to record from a lot of neurons, and that's probably why comparative biologists have long known that phenotypes are also low-dimensional. For example, most mammals have seven neck vertebrae, even though the long-necked giraffe might benefit from more, and the neckless whale could do with less. In phenotype space, therefore, only the subspace of mammals with seven neck vertebrae is densely occupied. Body forms within species can also be surprisingly simple: fruit fly wings are well-approximated by a single dimension (see first figure, [Alba et al.](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.66750))! What causes such a sparse occupation of phenotypic spaces?

### Functional causes of low-d patterns
The first shared type of cause for low-d patterns in neural and phenotypic space is functional. Low-dimensional neural activity can result from low-dimensional neural computation: Ff a brain area is engaged in a simple computation (say, integrating a noisy variable over time), it’s activity will also be simple. This intuition was formalised by [Gao et al.](https://doi.org/10.1101/214262), who showed that besides the number of task variables, the smoothness of neural activity also matters (Fig.~\ref{reaches}). If we record for a limited amount of time, and neural activity cannot behave erratically, the total number of brain states is necessarily limited.
