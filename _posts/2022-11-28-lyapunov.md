<span class="caption" STYLE="font-size:85%"> The pendulum loses energy until it stops in an equilbrium state (hanging down) with energy 0. 
 Since energy can never increase, this shows the equilibrium position is stable. Similar arguments can prove the stability of more complicated systems like neural network controllers, by using so-called Lyapunov functions that are analogous to energy. </span>
