<span class="caption" STYLE="font-size:85%"> The pendulum loses energy until it stops in an equilbrium state (hanging down) with energy 0. This can be used to prove that the down position is stable. Similar reasoning can be used to prove the stability of complicated systems like neural network controllers. In This requires so-called Lyapunov functions that are analogous to energy. </span>
